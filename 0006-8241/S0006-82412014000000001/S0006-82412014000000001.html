<h2>Abstract</h2>
        Background:     Berkheya   is a large, mainly southern African genus of approximately 75 species, several of which are poorly known and under-collected. Since revision in 1959, only a few new species have been described. Publication of new taxa facilitates conservation objectives and contributes to a better understanding of the southern African flora.   Objectives:  The objectives of this study were to describe a new species of  Berkheya , consider its taxonomic position within the genus and assess its conservation status.   Methods:  Macromorphology and micromorphology of the new species were compared with known species.   Results:   Berkheya dumicola  N.G.Bergh &amp;amp; Helme was described from two subpopulations from the northern Bokkeveld escarpment, Northern Cape Province, South Africa. The species is a tall shrub with radiate flowerheads, toothed receptacle alveole margins, a uniseriate pappus of small, rounded scales and very short twin-hairs on the cypsela.   Conclusion:   Berkheya dumicola  is a new species with a unique combination of features. Based on morphological characteristics, its closest relative within the genus is likely to be the recently described Berkheya chrysanthemoides  J.C.Manning &amp;amp; Goldblatt. The limited geographic extent and small population size of  B. dumicola  warrant an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) status of ‘Endangered’.
